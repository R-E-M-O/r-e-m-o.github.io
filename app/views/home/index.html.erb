<h1>About Me</h1>
<p id="paragraph-style">
  Welcome to my webpage! My name is Omer Hyajneh. I'm a student studying Computer Science Engineering at the Ohio State University.
   I'm currently specializing in software engineering while practicing other fields in my free time, such as web development and
   iOS development, and it is highly likely I will pursue AI in the future.
</p>

<h1>My Experience</h1>
<p id="paragraph-style">
    As a 4th year (as of writing this) CSE major in college, I've had the opportunity to complete both the fundamentals
    and some more in-depth classes in computer science, math, and more. Below is a list of classes I have taken
    which I believe have had a strong impact on my growth as an aspiring software engineer.
